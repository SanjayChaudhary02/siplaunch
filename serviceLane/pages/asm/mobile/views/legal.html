					<p>Information You Provide to Us</p>
					<p>We may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or business mailing address ("Personal Information")).  For example, Toyota may collect Personal Information when you register on the Site, request information, submit comments or participate in any Program on the Site, including but not limited to, sweepstakes, contests, special events, promotions, and surveys ("Programs") or other feature of the Site, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.</p>
					<p>Information We Collect Automatically</p>
					<p><h6>Usage Information.</h6>Whenever you visit or interact with the Site, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect  information about how the Site is accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Site, such as interactions with friends and group activities. This information helps us keep our Site fresh and interesting to our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor's interests. </p>
					<p><h6>Device Identifier.</h6>We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Site. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Site, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users' web page movements, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
					<p><h6>Cookies; Pixel Tags.</h6>The technologies used on the Site to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed).  Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Site and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Site (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information).  A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.</p>
					<p>To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser's cookie folder, please refer to your browser's help menu or other instructions related to your browser. If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our Site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Toyota account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</p>

					<p><h6>Business Transfers.</h6> Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities in the family of companies controlled by or under common control with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes.  We may also share your information with our authorized dealers, and private distributors for their own use.  As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.  If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to the Sites, Personal Information, Usage Information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of the Sites may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets.
